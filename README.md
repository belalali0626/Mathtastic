<h3 align="center">Introducing gamification to traditional teaching in mathmatics </h3>


  <p align="center">
 Project was created in support for KS2 Students. Background studies suggested inadequate resouces for students who lack motivation, or mathmatically challenged. This project was made in attempt to provide a solution. The project & tests was carried out following <a href="brunel.ac.uk">Brunel BREO</a> code of conduct.

### Note to readers
I originally intended to take this project through a commercial route refining the software in order for it to be widely used. But with my limited resources and time, it was not feasible. Hence, it is open source for anyone to improve and take it to the next step. My studies and tests suggested significant learning gains from its limited use. Which suggests to me there is grounds for it to be improved as it can be used to improve the academic learning space and give us programmers much more meaning if we can use our knowledge to do good.
